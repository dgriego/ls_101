In this assignment we want to delve into those topics at a deeper level.
Our goal here is to accomplish two things:

- Build on the definitions outlined in the previous assignment
- Provide a slightly more complex but more accurate mental model of methods,
  blocks, how they inter-relate, and how local variable scope fits into the picture

Method definition is when we define a method in Ruby using the `def` keyword

Method invocation is when we call a method whether that be methods you created
or methods from the Core API or Standard Library.
