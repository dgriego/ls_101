CSV and XLS/XLSX
----------------
these two formats are typically used for iporting and exporting tabular data
commonly found in spreadsheet applications.

for CSV, the Ruby Standard-lib does support csv files withe CSV class
for XLS/XLSX, Ruby does not have any built in support, but luckily we can utilize the
              `axlsx` gem

JSON and XML/HTML
-----------------
JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
XML - Extensible Markup Language
HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language (a standarized form of XML for describing elements on the web page)

for parsing XML/HTML files we can use the gem `Nokogiri`

JSON example:
{
  "newspaper_name": "Cooking Today",
  "issue_date": "November 15th, 2014",
  "articles": [
    {
      "title": "Bacon Cooking",
      "link": "http://baconcooklove.com",
      "summary": "Just a few thousand ideas about bacon"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cooking with leftovers",
      "link": "http://love.com",
      "summary": "Just a few thousand ideas about tasting love twice"
    }
  ]
}

<newspaper>
