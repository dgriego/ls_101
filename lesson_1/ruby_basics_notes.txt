Why do we need methods?

methods allow you to extract common code into one place
so that this common code can be executed by its 'name' rather
then reusing the same block of code in ever place it is needed.

Loops
-----
standard loops create their own scope due to the fact that loop
is a method on the Enumerator class and scope is initialized by
blocks in ruby
