1. a method that returns the sum of two integers.

START

GET integer_one
GET integer_two

PRINT integer_one + integer_two

END


2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is
   all those concatenated together.

START

# given an array of strings called "strings"

SET iterator = 0
SET new_string = ''

WHILE iterator < length of strings
  new_string = new_string + strings[iterator]

  iterator = iterator + 1
END

END

3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array
   with every other element

START

# given an array integers called "numbers"

SET iterator = 0
SET new_array = []

WHILE iterator < length of numbers
  IF iterator % 2 === 0
    new_array << number
END

RETURN new_array
