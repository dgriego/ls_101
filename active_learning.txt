Active Learning

even though all these tips are so practical and seem so simple, in general, I
don't practice them all.  This in part because I'm not consistent with my
learning habits.  The importance of these tips isn't to be hard on yourself, but
really the point is to say yes to one thing and make it your top priority, akin to
how I've treated video games.  I can't tell you how many hours I've sat aside
for video games or for art and how I would practice and refine mechanics and
practice perspective, its about repetition and muscle memory and after a certain
point its engrained in you.  Passion, motivation, and drive are great motivators
but they won't sustain you, you need ritual, exercise, healthy food, and focus.  Its now part of your process and I believe this is the goal for actively learning anything.
